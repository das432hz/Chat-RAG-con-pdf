The structural  elements of an atom are protons (positively charged), neutrons (no  charge), and electrons (negatively charged). Protons and neutrons  are contained in the dense nucleus of the atom; the nucleus thus has  a positive charge. Because opposites attract, electrons are attracted  to this nucleus and move around it in the electron cloud.  Electrons contain energy, and this energy is stored within the  charge and movement of electrons and the bonds atoms make with  one another. However, this energy is not always stable, depending  on the number of electrons within an atom. Atoms are more stable  when their electrons orbit in pairs. An atom with an odd number  of electrons must have an unpaired electron. In most cases, these  unpaired electrons are used to create chemical bonds. A chemical  bond is the attractive force between atoms and contains potential  energy. By bonding, electrons find pairs and chemicals become part  of a molecule.  Bond formation and bond breaking are chemical reactions that  involve the movement of electrons between atoms. These chemical  reactions occur continuously in the body. We previously reviewed  how glucose breaks down into water and carbon dioxide as part of  cellular respiration. The energy released by breaking those bonds  is used to form molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Recall  how during this process electrons are extracted from glucose in a  stepwise manner and transferred to other molecules. Occasionally  electrons “escape” and, instead of completing the cellular  respiration cycle, are transferred to an oxygen molecule.

Kidneys are not as effective in excreting metabolic products such as sodium, acid, and potassium, which can alter water balance and increase the risk for over- or underhydration. In addition, immune function decreases and there is lower efficiency in the absorption of vitamins and minerals. In addition, disorders of the nervous system can have profound effects. Dementia is the umbrella term for changes in the normal activity of the brain. Elderly adults who suffer from dementia may experience memory loss, agitation, and delusions. One in eight people over age sixty-four and almost half of all people over eighty- five suffer from the brain disorder Alzheimer’s disease, which is the most common form of dementia.2 Neurological disorder and psychological conditions, such as depression, can influence attitudes toward food, along with the ability to prepare or ingest food. They might lead some adults to overindulge to compensate for stress or emotions that are difficult to handle. Other adults might eat less or pay less attention to their diet and nutritional needs. Older adults may also need guidance from dietitians and health- care professionals to make the best dietary choices for this stage of life.',\n",
